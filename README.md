# DATA-STRUCTURES
## Data structures Using C language
> This repository contains beginner-friendly C programs that cover fundamental data structures, designed to be simple and easy to understand.

## Contents:

- **Arrays**: Basic operations, including insertion, deletion, and traversal, with examples.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with common operations.
- **Stacks**: Introduction to stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations, using both arrays and linked lists.
- **Queues**: Explanation of standard, circular, and priority queues with enqueue and dequeue operations.
- **Trees**: Overview of binary trees, binary search trees, and traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Graphs**: Introduction to graph data structures, including:
  - **Graph Representation**: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list.
  - **Graph Traversals**: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
  - **Minimum Spanning Tree**: Algorithms like Kruskal’s and Prim’s.
  - **Shortest Path**: Dijkstra’s algorithm.
  - **Maximum Flow**: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.

## Algorithms and their Descriptions:

- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**: 
  - **Description**: This algorithm finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It is based on the greedy approach and uses a priority queue to choose the node with the smallest tentative distance at each step.
  
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: 
  - **Description**: Kruskal’s algorithm is used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph. It works by sorting the edges of the graph by weight and adding them one by one to the MST, provided they don’t form a cycle.

- **Prim’s Algorithm**: 
  - **Description**: Prim’s algorithm is another algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Unlike Kruskal’s, it starts with an arbitrary node and grows the MST by adding the smallest edge that connects a node inside the MST to one outside it.

- **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm**: 
  - **Description**: This algorithm is used to compute the maximum flow in a flow network. It uses augmenting paths to push flow through the network until no more augmenting paths can be found. The algorithm’s efficiency can be improved using the Edmonds-Karp approach, which implements BFS for finding augmenting paths.

Each section includes well-documented code examples and explanations to help beginners grasp key concepts in data structures and algorithms.
